# CODSOFT_taskno2

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect whether an SMS message is spam or not. Spam detection is a common natural language processing (NLP) task that involves classifying messages based on the content, identifying malicious or unwanted messages, and helping improve the overall quality of communication platforms.

The project leverages different machine learning models to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The approach includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and training multiple models for optimal performance.
